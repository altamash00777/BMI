This is a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I created this project to help people track their health status and find out whether they are underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese.

It’s a simple, interactive web app that lets users:

Enter their height and weight

Instantly calculate their BMI

Get health feedback based on the result
